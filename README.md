# Text Editor - PWA

## Description

This is a text editor that runs in the browser that meets the PWA criteria. It feature use of localStore as well as an IndexedDB Database which means it will function offline as well. This project was a great way for me to learn and practice the fundamentals of progressive web applications using webpack. It uses custom service workers and creates a manifest.json file.

## Installation

- Have Nodejs installed (I used v16.18)
- Install npm dependencies
  - use 'npm install' on terminal once navigated to folder

## Usage

Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and install the dependencies with 'npm i' then start the server with npm start. The application will be deployed on your [localhost with port 3000](http://localhost:3000/). You can now use the text editor and it will save all changes you make automatically as you make changes to it. You can also visit a working application on heroku via the [heroku link section](#heroku-link)
